# For Loop in Python:
# A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
# It allows you to execute a block of code multiple times, once for each item in the sequence.
# Syntax:
# for item in sequence:
#     # code block to be executed
# Example 1: Iterating through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
